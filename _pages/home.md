Welcome to Peter Lab at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu) and the [MPI-EVA](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/staff/benjamin-peter) in Leipzig. 
We are a computational biology lab, and we work on a wide array of statistical and computational population genetic methods. 
Currently, we are in the middle of a (slow) transition to Rochester from
Leipzig, and are looking to [recruit postdocs, undergraduate and graduate
students.](mailto://b.peter@rochester.edu)

We are particularly interested in the following topics:
- Methods for the analysis of low-coverage ancient DNA
- Neandertals, Denisovans, modern humans, and our interactions
- Models for complex spatiotemporal population genetic structure 
- Visualizing genetic data


<br><br><br>
**We are currently building our group in Rochester, and we are looking for motivated students and postdocs. Please get in touch if you'd like to join the team!** 
Undergraduate students at UR are encouraged to apply via [AURA](https://joinaura.io/lab/Peter+Lab).
