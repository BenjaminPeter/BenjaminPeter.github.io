Welcome to Peter Lab!

We are a computational biology lab, currently at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu). **In March 2026, we are moving to [UCLA](https://qcb.ucla.edu)**.
Several group member are also based at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/staff/benjamin-peter) in Leipzig. 

and we work on a wide array of statistical and computational population genetic methods. 
Currently, we are in the middle of a (slow) transition to Rochester from
Leipzig, and are looking to [recruit postdocs, graduate students](mailto://benj.pet@gmail.com)
and [undergraduate students](mailto://benj.pet@gmail.com) at UCLA.

We are particularly interested in the following topics:
- Methods for the analysis of low-coverage ancient DNA
- Neandertals, Denisovans, modern humans, and our interactions
- Models for complex spatiotemporal population genetic structure 
- Visualizing genetic data

**We are currently building our group in UCLA, and we are looking for motivated students and postdocs. Please get in touch if you'd like to join the team!**
