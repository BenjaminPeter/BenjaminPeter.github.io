# Research

We work on developing and applying new statistical and computational methods
that use genetic data for better understanding how populations and species
evolve. Our goal is to develop new perspectives, new tools and new ideas to
interpret genetic data.

In the past years, we have been heavily focused on genetic data retrieved from
fossils (ancient DNA), particularly
from early modern humans, Neandertals and Denisovans. These data give us
unprecedented insights into how our ancestors lived, interacted and evolved.



### Population Genetics of Early Modern Humans, Neandertals and Denisovans

Human and Hominin Ancient DNA has recently provided a new way into how we can
study our distant past. Under ideal conditions, DNA can survive tens to hundreds
of thousands of years, and gives us a glimpse into populations from the past. 

In collaboration with the [Department of Evolutionary
Genetics](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/index) at the MPI for Evolutionary
Anthropology, group members contributed to several studies that published data
from Neandertals and early modern humans. For example, we led the first analysis
of the genetic data from an entire Neandertal community. This study, lead by
postdoc Laurits Skov, sequenced 13 new Neandertals from Chagyrskaya Cave (Altai
mountains, Russia). In it, we showed that the Neandertals from Chagyrskaya Cave
all lived at the same time, lived in very small communities, and that they were
mainly connected through female migration. This work has [been widely covered in print and online media](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05283-y/metrics).

### Methods for the analysis of Ancient DNA

Much of our contribution in the analysis of ancient DNA is in developing new
population genetic methods. One of the major challenges in ancient DNA is the
rapid increase in data; since the publication of the draft Neandertal genome in
2010, the field now produces genetic data from thousands of individuals each year. 
Our methods aim to leverage this wealth of information, while tackling the core
challenges pertaining to ancient DNA

 1. ancient genomes are sampled at different time points throughout history
 1. ancient DNA is often extremely sparse, low quality and contaminated
 2. we now have genetic information from hundreds to thousands of individuals we
    would like to analyze jointly.

For example, we recently published a new method, KIN, to infer familial
relatedness from low-coverage ancient DNA data. Another recent example of our work is the program [admixfrog](https://github.com/BenjaminPeter/admixfrog), that is able to estimate local ancestry from low-coverage, contaminated populations. Using it, we showed that Early East Asians that lived more than 30'000 years ago already had Denisovan ancestry, and that some of the earliest modern humans in Europe, from Bacho Kiro in Bulgaria, had very recent Neandertal ancestry.

### Genetic Diversity Through Space and Time

We now have genetic information from hundreds to thousands of people. Ideally,
we would like to analyze them jointly, but this is often difficult to
conceptualize, model and understand.

F-statistics are a set of statistics that are widely used for the analysis of
population structure, particularly in ancient DNA. Our work focuses on better
understanding these statistics.
